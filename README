Subject: [patch] amrmo_init.c for 2.6.10 kernels
Date: Sun, 9 Jan 2005 00:26:53 +0000

Hello Jacques, MarvS,

Below is patch for slmodem-2.9.9[-alsa]/drivers/amrmo_init.c .

This should fix 2.6.10 incompatibilities and still work with earlier
kernels.

Thanks and Best Regards,
Sasha.

Smart Link Soft Modem for Linux
-------------------------------


Introduction
============

This is Smart Link Soft Modem for Linux version 2.9. It provides
full-featured 56K Voice Fax Modem.
This is implemented as generic application (slmodemd) and set of
hardware specific kernel-space drivers (slamr, slusb).
ALSA modem drivers may be used instead of proprietary ones (see ALSA mode).

Features
========

Modem: V.92, V.90, V.34, V.32bis, V.32, V.23, V.22, V.21, Bell 103/212.
Flow control: V.42.
Compression: V.44, V.42bis.
Fax: Class 1.
Voice: V253 like modem.
Multiple modems are supported.


Supported Hardware
==================

HAMR5600 based AMR/CNR/MDC/ACR modem cards on the following Southbridge
chips:
- Intel ICH0,ICH2, ICH3, ICH4
- Via 686A, 686B, 8231, 8233
- SiS 630
- ALI 1535.
SmartPCI56/561/562/563 based PCI modem cards.
SmartUSB56 based USB modem.



Requirements
============

CPU: Intel Pentium II, Celron. AMD K6, Cyrix 500MHz or higher.
Memory: 64MB.

OS: Linux 2.4. You need the kernel header files at least (or full kernel
               source tree) installed and configured.
    Linux 2.6. You need the full kernel source tree installed and configured.

Note: Most Linux Distributions have 'ready to use' kernel source package -
      be sure that this is installed.


Installation
============

1. Unpack tar.gz package file:

	$ gzip -dc slmodem-2.9.X.tar.gz | tar xf -

2. 'cd' to package directory:

	$ cd slmodem-2.9.X

3. Review and edit 'Makefile' (if need):

   In many cases you will need to correct path to your local kernel
   source tree:

        KERNEL_DIR=/path/to/linux

   Default KERNEL_DIR is '/lib/modules/<kerne-version>/build'. Many Linux
   Distributions use directory '/usr/src/linux-<version>' also.

   Note: If you are using Linux kernel 2.4, only header files should be
         available for build in $(KERNEL_DIR)/include

   Another way to pass right value KERNEL_DIR is to use command line
   parameter while running 'make':

        $ make KERNEL_DIR=/path/to/linux ...

4. Run 'make' command to compile package:

	$ make

5. Install. As 'root' user run:

	# make install

   It will install:

   - application 'slmodemd' under '/usr/sbin' directory

   - hardware specific drivers (kernel modules) 'slamr' and 'slusb'
     under conventional kernel modules directory

   - character device nodes '/dev/slamr0-3' with major number 212
     (for pci modems) and '/dev/slusb0-3' with major number 213
     (for usb modems).

   - config modules for autoloading (by editing file '/etc/modules.conf')
     (only with 2.4 kernels)

6. Config modem country.

   Use AT+GCI=<T.35 country code> command to setup country.

   Also you can setup default modem country by passing command line
   parameter '--country=MY_COUNTRY' to program 'slmodemd'.

   See output of 'slmodemd --countrylist' for a list of supported
   country names and T.35 country codes (see also 'slmodemd --help').

   Note: Command ATI7 shows currently installed country setting.

8. Uninstallation.

   In package directory just type:

	# make uninstall


Getting Started
===============

After successful installation and configuration:

1. Load modem driver.

   Load your modem hardware specific kernel module:

	# modprobe slamr

   if you are using AMR/CNR/PCI modem, or

	# modprobe slusb

   if you are using SmartUSB56 Modem.

   Note: this will be done automatically when modules were
         configured for 'loading on demand'

   Note: this is safe to load both 'alamr' and 'slusb' modules.

2. Run soft modem application.

       # /usr/sbin/slmodemd [options] <device_name>

   Where device name is appropriate device node for your modem
   (look at output of 'dmesg' command).
   Run '/usr/sbin/slmodemd --help' for details.

   Examples:

       # /usr/sbin/slmodemd --country=USA /dev/slamr0

   , or for SmartUSB56 Modems:

       # /usr/sbin/slmodemd --country=ITALY /dev/slusb0

3. Using the modem.

   When 'slmodemd' is running this creates PTY (pseudo-terminal) to
   emulate modem port device, also this creates symbolic link
   like '/dev/ttySL0' (shown at startup).

   Config your application to use this link '/dev/ttySL0' (or PTY node
   itself) as modem port.

   Note: Some application want 'to know' that they are working with
         pseudo-terminal and may require additional configurations.

   Known application notes:

   - 'wvdial' requires option 'Carrier Check = no' in config file

   - some versions of 'kppp' may not work properly with devices named
     like '/dev/ttySL0'. To workaround this you may create symbolic link
     '/dev/modem' ( # ln -s /dev/ttySL0 /dev/modem ) and use this link
     as modem device with 'kppp'

4. Startup automation.

    There are examples of startup scripts in 'scripts' directory.


ALSA mode
=========

ALSA has the built-in modem drivers included in 'alsa-driver' >= 1.0.2
and in Linux kernel >= 2.6.5. Currently there is 'intel8x0m' (snd-intel8x0m)
modem driver, which supports ICH based AC97 modems (MC97).

1. Configure your kernel and enable ALSA and ICH based modem support
   ( 'Device Drivers' -> 'Sound' -> 'Advanced Linux Sound Architecture' ->
     'PCI devices' -> 'Intel i8x0/MX440; AMD768/8111 modems' ) .

2. Build and install kernel and modules as usual (make , make modules_install,
   etc.). ICH modem driver modem module name is 'snd-intel8x0m'
  (if was configured as module).

3. Build application 'slmodemd' with ALSA support. For this in
   slmodem-2.9.x dir:

      $ cd modem
      $ make SUPPORT_ALSA=1

   This will build 'slmodemd' with ALSA support. If compilation is failed
   review Makefile (near ALSA_SUPPORT condition) and define right library
   and/or CFLAGS

4. Use option '--alsa' when running 'slmodemd' and ALSA conventional
   device name ('hw:0' or 'hw:1' for instance). If modem support in
   the kernel was enabled as module module 'snd-intel8x0m' should be loaded.
   When using ALSA modem driver you don't need to load other modules ('slamr').


Troubleshooting
===============

If you get an error message during installation/configuration or loading
the modules try to see it in FAQ file.

Please report the problem to your modem provider or to us
(linux-support@smlink.com).
